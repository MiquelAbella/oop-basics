### The repo <!-- omit in toc -->

First, you will need to clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MiquelAbella/oop-basics.git
```

### PHP <!-- omit in toc -->

You can install it by following the instructions [in the official docs](https://www.php.net/downloads) (we recommend that you install the version that is named _Current_).

To verify that you have installed it correctly, you can run the following command from the terminal that should output the version installed:

```bash
$ php -version
```

## Tools

In the event that you prefer to use a tool that installs everything you need to configure and run a PHP server, we recommend using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/download.html)

### XAMPP <!-- omit in toc -->

XAMPP is a completely free and easy to install Apache distribution that contains MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. The XAMPP installation package has been designed to be incredibly easy to install and use.
